# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Fake news spreads rapidly through digital platforms and social media, leading to misinformation and confusion.  
This project builds a text classification model that analyzes news content and predicts whether it is:

- ✅ Real News  
- ❌ Fake News  

The system uses NLP preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models to make predictions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw news text data
- Convert text into numerical features
- Train classification models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Improve detection accuracy

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning model used)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
---

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Dataset contains two categories:
  - Fake news
  - Real news

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove punctuation
- Remove stopwords
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization / Stemming

### 3️⃣ Feature Extraction
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
OR  
- Word Embeddings (if using LSTM)

### 4️⃣ Model Building
Possible algorithms used:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- LSTM / BiLSTM (Deep Learning)

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 🔹 Option 1: Run in Google Colab

1. Open the notebook file.
2. Upload dataset files (fake.csv and true.csv).
3. Run all cells.

### 🔹 Option 2: Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
- Use advanced models like BERT or Transformers
- Build a real-time fake news detection web app
- Add model explainability (LIME / SHAP)

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Text preprocessing in NLP
- Feature extraction techniques (TF-IDF / Embeddings)
- Binary text classification
- Model evaluation metrics
- Deep learning for NLP (if LSTM used)
